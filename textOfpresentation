##Properties Required for ECash System
--Double Spending Prevention
--Non-Repudiation of Transactions
--Anonymity and Anonymity Revocation
--Transferability
--Divisibility and fungibility
--Scalability
--Hardware Independence 

##An Analysis of Anonymity in Bitcoin Using P2P Network Traffic. 
--real-time transaction traffic collected over 5 months
--developed heuristics for identifying ownership relationships between Bitcoin addresses and IP addresses. 
--In five months, able to link 1,162 bitcoin addresses to IP addresses while being connected to a median of 2,678 peers.

##Identifying the relay pattern
###relay pattern statistics
--Multi-Relayer, Non-Rerelayed Transactions: Approx 91.4 % of full traffic
--Single Rerelayer Transctions: Approx 2.5% of full traffic, Packets included invalid transactions which were immediately rejected. 
--Multi-Relayer, Rerelayed Transactions: Approx 6.04% of full traffic
